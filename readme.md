## Web application to handle upload and retrieval of image files to and from Amazon S3

As a photographer, I need a way to easily facilitate transfer of a large number of image files
to my clients.  At first, a Google Drive/Dropbox account with shared links sent via email/instant
messaging worked, but has a number of limitations.  I _could_ take the easy way and do something 
along the lines of PhotoShelter and other photography-oriented websites/applications but what is
the fun in that?  I'm using this as a learning experience and a way to test out new libraries with 
Django as well as React/Redux/etc in the front end.
